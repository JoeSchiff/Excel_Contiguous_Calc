# Excel_Contiguous_Calc

### How to select and perform work on a contiguous series of rows.

<br/>

### Example
Perform calculations on any contiguous range of cells.

All examples in this repo will use AVERAGE() as an example, but you can replace it with any calculation you want.

<br/>

### Workbooks

I provided 2 workbooks:<br/>
Basic example. The data and the formulas are on the same sheet: [contig.xlsx](https://github.com/JoeSchiff/Excel_Contiguous_Calc/blob/main/contig.xlsx)

If you want the formulas on a separate sheet, then use: [contig_diff_sheet.xlsx](https://github.com/JoeSchiff/Excel_Contiguous_Calc/blob/main/contig_diff_sheet.xlsx)

<br/>
Notice: The first row of the "Range" column has a slightly different formula than the other rows.
